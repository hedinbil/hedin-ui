                        We've made the decision to open source Hedin.UI, aligning with our values and vision
                        for the future of software development.

                        Great tools should be accessible to everyone who can benefit from them. Our component
                        library has proven its value within our organization, and we see no reason to keep
                        it locked away when it could help developers worldwide build better applications.

                        Open sourcing Hedin.UI represents more than just making code available - it's about
                        building trust and fostering collaboration. This transparency serves as a testament
                        to our development practices and standards.

                        this level of openness builds confidence in our work and encourages others to adopt
                        and contribute to our solutions.

                        We envision Hedin.UI becoming a valuable resource for the Blazor community and as
                        an extension of MudBlazor. We're committed to maintaining high standards while
                        embracing the collaborative spirit that makes open source so powerful.
