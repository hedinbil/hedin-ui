This catalog should contain private components only. Components that should not be reached or reused by consumers.
All of these components should have the namespace "Hedin.UI.Internal"


As of the time of writing, blazor has no way of creating internal or private components. These WILL be exposed to consumers anyway if user access the right namespace.
